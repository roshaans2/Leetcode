Full Binary Tree - Every node has either 0 or 2 children
Complete Binary Tree - All levels are completely filled except last level. The last level has all nodes in left as possible
Perfect Binary Tree - All leaf nodes are at same level

DFS has three techniques - Inorder Traversal, Preorder Traversal, Postorder Traversal

Inorder - letft->root->right
Preorder - root->left->right
Postorder - left->right->root
